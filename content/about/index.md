Welcome to my blog.

I'm not a big writer, so don't expect too much. But from time to time, I create posts, of what i'm doing, and what I think, others could find interesting.

Most posts will probably be around cloud Native developemnt, and things in that space. But I might wander off, and do other stuff as well :-) 

If you want to follow, what I'm doing, then follow me on github. That is where I put everything I do.

I'm also also happy for a connect on Linkein or bluesky.
