Welcome to my little blog.

I'm not a big writer, so don't expect much. But sometimes, I might create small posts, of what i'm doing, and what I think, others could find interesting.

Most of my time, is spend, changing from a Operations background, to learn a lot more around Development. So expect, content to be around that theme.

If you want to follow, what I'm doing, then follow me on github. That is where I put everything I do.
