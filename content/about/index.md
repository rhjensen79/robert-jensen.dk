Welcome to my little blog.

I'm not a big writer, so don't expect much. But sometimes, I might create small posts, of what i'm doing, and what I think, others could find interesting.

Most of my time, is spend, changing from a Operations background, to learn a lot more around Development. So expect, content to be around that theme.

If you want to follow, what I'm doing, then follow me on github. That is where I put everything I do.

### Work

Been +10 years @vmware. Since 2021 it's been as a Lead solutions engineer in the Modern applications business unit.

### Interests

- Family.
  I have 2 small girls, that take up all my time. 
- MTB (when time permits)
- Crossfit
- Roadracing
- Neerdy stuff :-)
