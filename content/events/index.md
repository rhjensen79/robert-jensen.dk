- 15.8.2023 - 3.10.2023 : [Tanzu CNA Webinars](https://webinars.tanzu.dk)

    I'm running a series of 6 webinars, around Cloud Native Applications.
    The idea, is to introduce new people to the benefits of cloud Native, and show some of the methodologies, technologies etc. in that space.
    We are starting fro scratch, and working ourself up until Developer Platforms. So there should be something for skill levels.
