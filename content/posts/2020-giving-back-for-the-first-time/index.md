One thing, I have been weanting to do, ever since I started larning Python, and started using Github, was to give back, to one or more projects. 
I remember reading, how to get started doing this, but I see myself as a beginner, when it comes to coding, and find myself thinking, "why would anybody want something, that I have done."

The article I read, was about helping with enhancing code. Improving graphics. Improving documentation etc. But imho it's not that easy, to just jump in, and start participating.

But it finalily happend, and not in the way I would have thought. 

Since I moved away from blogger, an into Hugo, with this blog, I have been using the anatole theme. And I have been watching the Git repo, for changes. 

I really like this repo, but my skills in web programming, is close to non existing, so i'm just a user here. 
But then I noticed, that the theme had localications, in different languages, and I took a look at the files. It was really simple, and there were no Danish file. So I guss you csn figure out the rest :-) 

I forked the repo, and added a danish file, with the translations, and created an issue, to put in back into the master branch (I hope I explanined it correctly here :-)  )

It quickly got accpeted and merged, and the other day, I got an update from the creator, saying that version 4 was released, and thank you, to all the contributors. And there I was, among a lot of other people. 

So my point of this post, is to show, that anybody can do this, and give something back. And it's not that hard, and does not require that much. 

So I hope, that more of you out there, want to do the same. It's not the last time for me (I have actualily, already done it 2 more times, since :-)  ).
When you know how it works, it's quite easy, to help fix small issues, that you come across. 

If you don't know how to do this, and want to, then hit me up on Twitter, and I will be happy, to setup a test git repo, so you can try it out, without breaking anything :-) 

Hope this peaked your interest, and you are ready to start helping out.
