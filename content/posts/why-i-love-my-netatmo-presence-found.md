I love my [Netatmo Presence](https://www.netatmo.com/en-US/product/security/presence). The reason is due to it's abilities to detect different types of objects like cars, people, animals and other.

  

Due to that, I found that i had a visit, from somebody, who was probably trying to grab my bike, in the middle of the night.

  

It was just a short recording, but i detected it, since presence let me know, that it saw a person, at 2.40 in the night. We have a lot of cars driving by, so normally i would never see a recording like this, but in this case, i looked, as saw the guy below.

  

  

He got scared by the light.Â 

After this, i also added some Homekit Automation (more about that, in a later post), so that when my camera detects something, in the night, i also turns on all my lights outside, for a while.

That should make sure, no thief can come unnoticed to my house again.
