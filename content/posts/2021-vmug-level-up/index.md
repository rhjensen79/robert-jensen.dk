For the [Danish VMUG summermeeting](https://sommer2021.eventbrite.com/), on the 2 June 2021, I had the pleasure of presenting, "How to level up, as a vSphere admin".

A presentation, around what tools/technologies, to look at, if you are doing infrastructure today, to prepare, for the future.

This post, will be published, during the presentation, as part of the last demo. 
It is also ment, af a placeholder, for the content, that was mentioned in the presentation.

The GitHub repo, that was used during the presentation, can be found here [https://github.com/rhjensen79/vmug_level_up](https://github.com/rhjensen79/vmug_level_up)
