So VMware bought SaltStack, and that means, that I have to start looking into SaltStack, to learn more, since it falls into my Business Unit (BU).

If that sounds like a complaint, it's not. 
Imho the most exiting part of my job, is having to learn new stuff, every time we do some new integration, or buy a company.
Just looking at the last couple of years, I can think of Git, Docker, Artifactory, cloud-init, Jenkins, Yaml, Pipelines, Packer,  Python, Ansible, Terraform, K8S, and now SaltStack, as things I needed to learn. Thinkgs that are not, an essential part of my day 2 day set of tools, that define the way I work.

I'm in no way a expert, in these tools, but I get to get a basic knowledge of them, and find out, where they fit in, and when i need them, I can dig deeper, and use them.

These days i'm attending a SaltStack course, to get a lot more hands on. 
I won't share code or snippets from SaltStack (yet), but I do see, some new VRA extensibility, comming to my git repo soon (https://github.com/rhjensen79/vra-extensibility) since there is a lot a interesting usecases, where it could make sense to call out to SaltStack, to do automation.
