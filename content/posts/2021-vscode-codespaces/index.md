Last year, I wrote about development from anywhere (TODO: Link).
One of the big limitations, has always been, to have an enviroment, that has all the dependencies, that I need, for that project.

That's why, one of the big things, that I has been looking forward to, was Github Codespaces.
Hosnestly, what I was looking forward to the most, was being able to use VS Code, from my ipad. 
That has proven not to work for me. The last of screen space, etc. just makes it to difficult, to create anything, what way I like to. So I really havent been using Codespaces, since it was released. 

But a couple of days ago, I found the VS Code extentions for Codepsaces. And damn I was blown away. 

I have been doing all my coding, inside containers, for the last couople of month, and is really loving it. 
But for some of my projects, it sounds like, i'm trying to kill my Macbook, when I sping up a new dev container enviroment. 
But being able to use Codespaces, gived me 4 cpu's and 8 gb of memory, in a remote container. For projects, that don't require local direkct connection, to local ressourcers, that is really amazing, and it keeps my computer silent, and run's really fast.
