For the last +4 years, I have had the role, of Cloud Management Specialist @ VMware.

Starting 1 of november, I have been given the oppertunity, to change to our Modern Applications business unit, to focus on our [Tanzu platform](https://tanzu.vmware.com/tanzu).

Having spend the last couple of years, focusing on DevOps, and trying to understand what developers want/need, and how Operations can provide this, makes this a natural next step.

That said, i'm comming from an operations background, and just looking at the ecosystem in this space, means that i'm stepping into (for me) unknown terretory. 

But I can't remember that last time, I was this exited about a new role, and I can't wait to get started, and to start learning. 

So expect a lot more application focused content, from my side, in the future.
