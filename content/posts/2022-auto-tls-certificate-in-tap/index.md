description: "How I deploy applications in my setup"
---

In my home setup, I have several tings running, and I thougt it could be interesting, for others, so hear how I do things, for inspiration.
I don't do things the most easy way (to begin with), but I do like to make it as easy to maintain, going forward, and I always have a focus, on trying to learn, some of the techniques used in the "real world" where possible,

In this blog post, I will focus on an application, that I use daily. It's the dashboard app [Homer](https://github.com/bastienwirtz/homer)
I use this as a easy bookmark page, for the services I use in my job, mostly when i'm doing demos, to have fast access to them.

The app, is deployed on a single node Kubernetes cluster, in [Oracles free forever tier](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/) on a Ubuntu VM, running [MicroK8S](https://microk8s.io)
