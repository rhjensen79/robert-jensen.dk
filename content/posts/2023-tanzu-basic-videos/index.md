## Intro

I often get the question "How can I deploy Tanzu Kubernetes on vSphere" when I meet new customers.
The question often comes from the vSphere admins, that want to know, how to deliver this "new" type of service, to their users.

So I set out to create a couple of basic videos, showing just that.

!!! I will be adding more videos to this page, as they are being published.
