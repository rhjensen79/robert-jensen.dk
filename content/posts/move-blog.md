for the last year or so, I have seen a lot of people, talking about their move of blogs, from a traditionel CMS system, to a static site.

I have had this on my todo, for quite some time, but I have also been quite satisfied, with blogger.

But the other day, I saw som tweets around it again, and thought that now is the time.

So this is herby my first post, on my news static site, using Hugo thru Netlify.com

No reason to makee this to hard, so now it's running, and i can start to use, my favorite tools, these days (VS Code), to write blogs as well :-) 

Who knows, this might even mean more posts, comming from me. Or at least just a faster site. 

Regards

/Robert

ps. Until i get it fixed, there might be some sizing and layout issues, with the site, and posts.
