for the last year or so, I have seen a lot of people, talking about their move of blogs, from a traditionel CMS system, to a static site.

I have had this on my todo, for quite some time, but I have also been quite satisfied, with blogger. But the fear of Blogger being shutdown, like so many other services, have long had me thinking about alternertives.

The other day, i saw a couple of tweets around it again, and descided, that now was the time. 

Lokking at how easy it was, and how long it took, i should have done this, a long time ago.

So this is herby my first post, on my news static site, using Hugo thru Netlify.com

No reason to makee this to hard, and do a lot of customization, on the site/Theme etc. That will come. 

I'm hoping, since this is now being deveopled, in the same app, as i use a lot of my time (VS Code), there might even some more blogs out of it. But no promises :-) 

Hopy you enjoy, the new (fast) site. 

Regards

/Robert

ps. Until i get it fixed, there might be some sizing and layout issues, with the site, and posts.
