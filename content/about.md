Welcome to my little blog.

I'm not a big writer, so don't exect much. But sometimes, I might create small posts, of what i'm doing, which I think, others might find interesting. 

Most of my time, is spend, changing from a Operations background, to learn a lot more around Development. So expect, content to be around thatt theme.

If you want to follow, what I'm doing, then follow me on github. That is where I put everything I do.
