Welcome to my little blog. 
I'm not a big writer, so don't exect much. But sometimes, i might post small posts, of what i'm doing, which i think, others might find interesting. 

Most of my time, is spend, going from a Operations background, to learn a lot more around Development. So expect, content to be around that. 

### Work
- Lead cloud managemt specialist @VMware

- Crossfit
- Roadracing
- Neerdy stuff :-)
