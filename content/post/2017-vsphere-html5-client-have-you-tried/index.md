From time to time, people have asked me "When do you fix the vSphere web client", or "When will the C# client come back"  
Most of the time, people don't know about VMware's new HTML5 client, and have not tried it.  
  
I must admit, that I loved the old C# client, and I had a hard time, converting to the flash Web client.  
But I really love the HTML5 client, and with every update, it gets better and better.  
The only bad thing I can say about the new client, is that it's not feature complete yet, but we are getting closer every day.  
  
VMware released a KB explaining some of the questions, people might have. You can find it [here](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/2147929)  
  
You can also read VMwares thoughts on the new client, in this blog post, and also find useful links, if you want to learn more. You find it [here](https://blogs.vmware.com/vsphere/2017/08/goodbye-vsphere-web-client.html).  
  
If you are not on vSphere 6.5, or if you want to try out all the latest features, on the new client, i recommend trying out the HTML5 fling.  
  
It acts as a proxy, in front of your normal vCenters, so you can still use your old client, while trying the new client as well. You can find the fling [here](https://labs.vmware.com/flings/vsphere-html5-web-client).  
  
One thing, that the KB explains, is that the fling gets updates almost every week. So it's an easy way to keep up to date, with all the new features. In 2017 the Fling was updated 33 times, so a lot is happening there.  
  
I found a video, showing the HTML5 client. You can watch it below.  
  
  
  
Update 09/01/2018 : It seams that in vSphere 6.5 U1d the HTML5 client was updated as well. You can see the changes here :Â [https://blogs.vmware.com/vsphere/2018/01/vcenter-server-6-5-update-1d-includes-third-update-html5-vsphere-client.html?src=so\_5a314d05e49f5&cid=70134000001SkJn](https://blogs.vmware.com/vsphere/2018/01/vcenter-server-6-5-update-1d-includes-third-update-html5-vsphere-client.html?src=so_5a314d05e49f5&cid=70134000001SkJn)
