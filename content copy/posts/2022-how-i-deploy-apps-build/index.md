Continued from previus post.

## Build

The way I build my containers, is by using [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)

For me the learning curve was steap, but I think that was mostly due to it being something different, and not that the solution was difficult.

Today, I use Github Actions for as many things as possible.

The remove my dependency for my own enviroment, to be running, And i really like that :-)
