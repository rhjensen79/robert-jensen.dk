      <description>Here is a short post, around my first integration between SaltStack and vRealize Automation.
Expect this to be updated, as I get more experience in SaltStack.
Note VMware (The company I work for), bought SaltStack, so I don&amp;rsquo;t know, what the future plans look like, and if this is the correct way going forward, to do this kind of integration.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m no expert in containers, but I do talk to a lot of admins in my job, that has not taken the time, to look at containers yet, and therefore haven&amp;rsquo;t found, if they can be a usefull tool, for them.
I think it has a lot to do, with containers, being something developers use, and all the talk around Kubernetes (K8S).</description>

      <description>I am always looking for new ways to do demo&amp;rsquo;s, and to showcase the solutions the company I work for have. One usecase, that I really wanted to show, was infrastructure as code (IAC), using a combination of both VMware and opensource tools. But not just as a deploy and destroy, but also as a way to maintain state in something that keeps running, and do the changes, from a source repository, like Github.</description>

      <description>For the last year or so, I have seen a lot of people, talking about their move of blogs, from a traditionel CMS system, to a static site.
I have had this on my todo, for quite some time, but I have also been quite satisfied, with blogger (my old blog hosting).</description>

      <description>Welcome to my little blog.
I&amp;rsquo;m not a big writer, so don&amp;rsquo;t exect much. But sometimes, I might create small posts, of what i&amp;rsquo;m doing, and what I think, others might find interesting.
Most of my time, is spend, changing from a Operations background, to learn a lot more around Development.</description>

      <guid>https://www.robert-jensen.dk/posts/2020-jenkins-and-codestream-csrf-fix/</guid>
      <description>For some time, I have had the problem with Jenkins, that when I ran my Code Stream pipeline, it gave me the following error 
To fix it, I have been running the code below, in the Jenkins &amp;ldquo;Script Console&amp;rdquo; import jenkins.model.Jenkins
def instance = Jenkins.instance
instance.setCrumbIssuer(null)
This has been ok, until my container, running Jenkins, restarted or got updated, and then I got the error again.</description>

      <description>A couple of years ago Jad El-Zein (@virtualjad) created a demo, where he ordered a VM (I think it was) using Siri on his iPhone, with vRealize Automation (VRA).
As a side project, to another thing, I&amp;rsquo;m working on, I thought I would recreate that demo, in a 2020 VRA Cloud version.</description>

      <description>Being able to show the value, of automation is essential, to be able to keep getting support, for the time you spend on it.
One of my coworkers (Tore Brynaa) , gave me an idea, on how we could show that value back to the business, for the customers that have begun using vRealize Automation.</description>

      <description>VScode is that type of software, that I hated in the beginning, and now love (for the most part).
I have never been any good at coding, scripting etc. but the more my day job, exposes me to automation, the more I want to learn. And along with that, I found out, that VScode, was one of the thing, I better learn to love (or live with).</description>

      <description>I have started a new Cloud Management (CMP) series where I want to show, just how easy it is to get started at doing CMP.
It&amp;rsquo;s all in Danish, to keep it local, but I will will update this post, to keep all the videos in one place.
1. Multi Cloud Blueprints in Cloud Assembly.</description>

      <description>I have been playing a bit with Kubernettes (K8S) lately.
Since it&amp;rsquo;s running on my vSphere environment, and not a public cloud, I don&amp;rsquo;t have native access to a load balancer, so I have to use the Ingress Controller instead.
Right now i&amp;rsquo;m using Rancher to deploy the K8S cluster, and due to lack of static ipadresses on my nodes, a LoadBalancer is not an easy thing to get working, it seams.</description>

      <description>After reading a blog post, from Cody&amp;rsquo;s blog thehumblelab.com, about how to create automated vSphere templates, using Packer.
I have been using it, for most of my vSphere templates in my demo lab at work.
But it has not been without problems. I have been having a problem with my Ubuntu templates.</description>

      <description>I have been a (happy) long time user of Keepass.
It was the place to store passwords, notes etc, across many of the systems I use today.
That means mostly OSX, but also a bit Windows, and in some cases IOS as well.
The way I used it, was by having my kdb file, in a dropbox share, that I then accessed from all my devices.</description>

      <description>For the last couple of days, I have been playing quite a lot with Cloud Automation Services.
That means deploying a lot of VM&amp;rsquo;s, just to destroy them again.
Some time ago, I got help, from some good colleagues, to setup a Python Slack notification, using the extensibility on AWS Faas.</description>

      <description>VMware Cloud Automation Services went GA 2 days ago, on the 15/1/2019.
There is already a ton of blogs, describing the solution.
I thought that I would give my view on one of the things, that i find most cool about the solution.
Note that i&amp;rsquo;m no expert, but I already love the solution, and i&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to learning more about what I, and the customers I talk to, can do with it.</description>

      <description>I finally got started on Cloud Automation Services (CAS), or at least Cloud Assembly.
Living in Denmark, where many customers are talking Azure all the time, and the local vSphere environments, are smaller, the SAAS offering makes a lot of sense IMHO.
I must admit I already love the product, even thou it requires some learning, to get the hang of it.</description>

      <description>For that last 2 years, I have been playing around with Home Automation.
So far i&amp;rsquo;m running a mix of both an Openhab installation, based on MQTT, and some Homekit devices (Philips hue etc).
Openhab is a great product, but I was finding myself, more and more, using Homekit, controlled from my ATV4, to be the way i do home automation.</description>

      <description>I had a customer asking me yesterday, if it was possible to use Log Insight, to monitor changes done to the Domain Admins group.
An interesting use case, that i had not thought of before.
The answer is off course yes, so i thought i would write a small post about it.</description>

      <description>A lot of my work time, these days, is spend on preparing a new thing we have in Denmark. It&amp;rsquo;s called Cloud Management Experience day.
We have already been running the same for VSAN, NSX and EUC.
The idea is to have customers participating in a full day og learning, where they can experience our products.</description>

      <description>So i bought a new gadget. After hearing my collegaue, telling me about it, and I was sold.
Fing.io is a free network scanner app for IOS (and Android).
They extended it, by connecting it to a physical device, that connects to your router, and monitors your network.
It only need a cable in your router, and power, then you are done.</description>

      <description>Do you know the cost of your datacenters, and what the cost would be, if you had to move your workloads to the public Cloud ?
One of the products, that can help with that, is VMware vRealize Business.
It&amp;rsquo;s probably one of the most overlooked products, in VMwares portfolio.</description>

      <description>I love my Netatmo Presence. The reason is due to it&amp;rsquo;s abilities to detect different types of objects like cars, people, animals and other.
Due to that, I found that i had a visit, from somebody, who was probably trying to grab my bike, in the middle of the night.</description>

I do however, upload everything to my NAS using ftp, for safe keeping.</description>

      <description>One of the tasks, i often en up doing, when i work with vRealize Automation (vRA), is doing a catalog scan. The Catalog scan, checks for changes in my endpoints. This could be new templates, snapshots etc. hat i need in my blueprints.
To do this manually, you have to go to Infrastructure -&amp;gt; Compute Ressources -&amp;gt; Your endpoint -&amp;gt; Data collection -&amp;gt; Request now (under inventory).</description>

The product is called vRealize Suite Lifecycle manger, not to be mistaken for en earlier product VMware had, that was also called Lifecycle Manager.
The tool is fairly easy to install.</description>

      <description>From time to time, people have asked me &amp;ldquo;When do you fix the vSphere web client&amp;rdquo;, or &amp;ldquo;When will the C# client come back&amp;rdquo;
Most of the time, people don&amp;rsquo;t know about VMware&amp;rsquo;s new HTML5 client, and have not tried it.
I must admit, that I loved the old C# client, and I had a hard time, converting to the flash Web client.</description>
